# RookieTraining2017-2018
Training tool for the 2017-2018 rookies. 
Will be used to build the rookie's confidence in how to use Github and working on a project.

Code Created Will be Based on Heimdall Code

The training this year will be conducted using old Heimdall Code as a reference and shoud be able to be run on Heimdall error free.
Rookies will be either working on this project in pairs or as individuals and will each be working on a seperate branch. Each pair
or individual will be creating a robot from scratch using Eclipse and referencing old robot code in order to create all subsystems and 
commands neccessary to run the robobt. If working as a pair it is expected each person provides about the same amount of work to the
project. Branches will be monitered by the people teaching (mainly Skyler and a little of Darius), and rookies will be taught how to
properly merge branches and commit so PRs are easier. Code written will be examined and wil be made sure that it follows all 
conventions the team follows in order to make programming easily readable and editable in the future. In order to test code, rookies may 
use the practice board and be taught how to test properly and efficiently using what we have on it. No code will be placed on Heimdall
until it is all finalized and ready to be tested.

Once each pair or individual is ready they will be able to test and upload code onto Heimdall and see if it works or not.

At the end of this each rookie should feel confident in basic Github usage, robot code generation, and how to reference and use old code.

This is a explination of the 2017-2018 teaching plan

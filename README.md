# RookieTraining2017-2018
Training tool for the 2017-2018 rookies. 
Will be used to build the rookie's confidence in how to use Github and working on a project.

Code Created Will be Based on Heimdall Code

The training this year will be conducted using old Heimdall Code as a reference and shoud be able to be run on Heimdall error free.
Rookies will be either working on this project in pairs or as individuals and will each be working on a seperate branch. Each pair
or individual will be creating a robot from scratch using Eclipse and referencing old robot code in order to create all subsystems and 
commands neccessary to run the robobt. If working as a pair it is expected each person provides about the same amount of work to the
project. Branches will be monitered by the people teaching (mainly Skyler and a little of Darius), and rookies will be taught how to
properly merge branches and commit so PRs are easier. Code written will be examined and wil be made sure that it follows all 
conventions the team follows in order to make programming easily readable and editable in the future. In order to test code, rookies may 
use the practice board and be taught how to test properly and efficiently using what we have on it. Such as how to diagnose simple test 
board issues and how to correctly id talons in order to test code and how to read the pnuematic control module to understand solonoid IDs.
No code will be placed on the robot until it is all finalized and ready to be tested. 

Once each pair or individual is ready they will be able to test and upload code onto Heimdall and see if it works or not.

At the end of this each rookie should feel confident in basic Github usage, robot code generation, and how to reference and use old code.



After all rookies have completed this they will all be assembled onto one large team and tasked to reprogram the current offseason robot.
Each person will be assigned different subsystems and will have code they can reference, but no copy and pasting. Branches will be made 
and merged realistically into the main branch. Any complex systems such as PID, Autoshifting, and on this current robot E-Stop will be 
explained how they work and how to test them safely and in a PID's circumstance how to tune one quickly. Once the robot has been
reprogrammed and tested. Rookies will be taught how to make a Autonomous command and be expected to make one that follows that years game
or what the senior programmers want them to do. 

Realistically this should take less than 6 weeks. If it takes longer it will be checked to see why and any issues found will be corrected.

At the end of both of these projects these programmers will be fully competent for general robot programming in the progromming 
committe and should be able to trust and rely on each other for projects to get done. And have a strong enough understanding of the test 
board in order to get it to work if no one from electrical is there (which is sometimes the case). Each programmer at this point can do 
what they want in the committee under the head programmers supervision, such as random offseason projects and practicing coding on
different old robots, or adding new features to existing robobts.

This is a explanation of the 2017-2018 teaching plan
